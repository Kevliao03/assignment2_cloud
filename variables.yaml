# Purpose:
#    This yaml file declares the different variables. It uses
#    a Python dictionary syntax
#

# I have already defined these two variables, which are used
# in the master playbook.
# @@ make sure to add the local user's username @@
local_user: Kurt

cloud_user: cc # user on chameleon VMs is cc
flavor: m1.medium

project_id: CH-822922
keypair: consumer
network: CH-822922-net
security_group: ENABLE_SSH
instance_name: VM_TEST
# @@ You have to add additional variables here that you need
#    in the different children playbooks. This could be things
#    like VM properties such as VM name prefix, the flavor like
#    m1.medium, project number and all the things you need to
#    create the VM.
